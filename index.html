        <h1>Hi, I'm Ben.<h1>
        <h2> I'm a composer based in New York.</h2>
        <p>I’m influenced by classical, jazz, and video game music. I’ve always been intrigued by music’s potential to enhance your emotional experience. Whenever I write music, I think about transporting the listener into new worlds.

        <div id="about">
          <p>I first discovered music when I started playing guitar at a young age. I took music lessons and played in a band at a music school near my home. Later, I joined the school’s Jazz ensemble and discovered Jazz and improvisation. I also took music classes in high school and learned about music theory as well as the complexities of classical compositions. When I got into 10th grade, I discovered Ableton Live and first started messing around and experimenting with creating music in a DAW. My first compositions weren’t great at all, I’d even say they were worse than most people when they started, but after a few months due to my experience improvising and playing music I was able to start making things that were listenable.
          </p>
          <p>After around a year of practicing and Improving, I was able to get a scholarship to the Mastermind music production program and after taking this class my music production skills dramatically improved. I finally felt like I was able to create music that people would enjoy. Right now, I’m expanding my horizons and learning more about different compositional styles to improve my work.
