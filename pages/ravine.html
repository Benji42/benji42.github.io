        The Drmaner Ghrzunök (Ravine of the Fallen) is a sacred chasm located near <a href="lake.html">Njechenmüje</a> and <a href="capital.html">Kiren Schrie</a>. According to myth, if one departs fighting for one they love their souls may rest at the bottom of this great pit. The vast crystal deposits found at the bottom of the ravine are thought to have been nourished by the souls of those fallen in the past. However, the truth remains unknown.

        I need to wonder the mechanism that allows for souls to be transfered into the Drmaner Ghrzunök. My research has shown a vast amount of aether eminating from the depths of the pit, but no magic that I'm aware of would allow the energy to get there. I don't even know why souls would want to be there in the first place. There isn't anything special about the location, par the aetheric concentration, but this concentration wouldn't have been here before the first soul arrived. Why did the first soul choose here? I don't know. But I believe there must have been a special connection to this place that allowed the Ravine to be the soul's final resting place. I would like to discover what this is in further research, but I would also need to descend deeper into the pit. Due to the large amount of aether, I cannot be sure if that's safe. This mystery may never be solved.
