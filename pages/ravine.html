        The <a href="ravine.html">Drmaner Ghrzunök</a>, or Ravine of the Fallen, is a sacred chasm located near <a href="lake.html">Njechenmüje</a> and <a href="capital.html">Kiren Schrie</a>. According to myth, if one departs fighting for one they love their souls may rest at the bottom of this great pit. The vast crystal deposits found at the bottom of the ravine are thought to have been nourished by the souls of those fallen in the past. However, the truth remains unknown.

        I need to wonder the mechanism that allows for souls to be transfered into the Drmaner Ghrzunök. My research has shown a vast amount of aether eminating from the depths of the pit, but no magic that I'm aware of would allow the energy to get there. I don't even know why souls would want to be there in the first place. There isn't anything special about the location, par the aetheric concentration, but this concentration wouldn't have been there before the first soul arrived. Why did the first soul choose here? I don't know. But I believe there must have been a special connection to this place that allowed the Ravine to be the soul's final resting place. I would like to discover what this is in further research, but I would also need to descend deeper into the pit. Due to the large amount of aether, I cannot be sure if that's safe. This mystery may never be solved.

      It's overwhelming standing next to Drmaner Ghrzunök. You can feel there's a deep love eminating from the chasm. But there's also a feeling of longing in the air.

      The few times one has attempted to journey into the ravine, by design or by mistake, it is unknown what happened to them. Even though the bottom can be seen in many places, no corpses have ever been spotted. In addition, no one has ever been seen leaving either.

      The phenomeona experienced here seems similar to <a href="gnarsh.html" style="color: black">The Tower of Gahë-Pei</a> in the <a href="gnarsh.html" style="color: black">Gnarsh</a>. At least in terms of aetheric density.
