        <p> Once upon a time, there lived a dwarf named Gnarloch. He lived in the far reaches of Drevenmüir’s great plains, in a humble home. Gnarloch, or plainly Arloch as he was known at this time, never had much. But he was content.<br>
            <p>Growing up, Arloch became interested in reading the old stories. There was a particular one that he always came back to– the story of the Rware Älmagi. He was always fascinated by the great power harnessed by this great mage. Arloch hoped to meet the mage one day, but he never wanted to leave his comfortable life.</p>
            <p>One day, a messenger came to his humble house and delivered a brief letter. Arloch opened the letter, and saw written in dark red ink the name of the high prince of the neighboring village. Arloch read the letter quickly, and gulped. It seemed his humble house was his house no more. The high prince decided that the land should be used as his own personal gardens and Arloch must go. There was nothing he could do to fight back, so he left with the little possessions he had.</p>
            <p>With nowhere to go and little to be lost, Arloch decided to brave the high mountains in search of the Rware Älmagi. The journey was going well until he heard a large rumble. Arloch knew the trek was dangerous but decided to keep going. Then, a bigger rumble. And a bigger one. And bigger! And bigger! Despite all this, Arloch continued. Suddenly, a large rock fell right in the middle of Arloch’s path and jumped back. Again, a rock fell beside him. And again! And again. It was an avalanche. Fear was the last thing Arloch remembered before getting struck on the head by a little, flat rock.</p>
            <p>Waking up, Arloch not knowing how many days and nights had passed, he was greeted by a soothing voice.</p>
            <p>“You’re finally awake?”</p>
            <p>“Yes..” Arloch replied, a little confused at first how he ended up in this situation. He was still grateful for the help, of course.</p>
            <p>“Oh. I can see your confused, little one. I happened to come across you while coming home from my expedition to the Gnoblin’s Gnarsh. There was a great avalanche and it almost took you out!” the voice laughed. “I guess I should explain who I am. I’m the Rware Älmagi”</p>
            <p>“Rware…. Älmagi?” he replied blankly. As it’s not every day you get to meet your greatest heroes, Arloch was understandably taken aback. In addition, Arloch didn’t think she would be a burly dwarven woman– a very beautiful one at that.</p>
            <p>“Yes. That definitely is me!” she laughed once again.</p>
            <p>“Do you think you could teach me?” Arloch said– maybe a bit too quickly. “I want to learn the ways of your magic. Please allow me!”</p>
            <p>“Well– I don’t usually take on disciples. But I can feel your longing determination and your kind heart. I can teach you, if you’re willing to do whatever if takes.”</p>
            <p>“I am.”</p>
            <p>For months and months, Gnarloch trained day and night. Under the guidance of the Älmagi, he was able to become one of the greatest mages in all of Drevenmüir.</p>
            <p>One day, the Rvare Älmagi came to Arloch with saddening news. A group of dwarven soldiers from the Empire was moving towards a big city near at the great mines of Hrkerghrgän. Their intention was clear– they wanted to have the great mines to themselves, no matter how many would be slaughtered in the process. This was finally Arloch’s time to test his newfound power.</p>
            <p>The battle was just decisively won. The city did not have a big enough army to defend itself, but with the help of Arloch and the Älmagi, they were able to persevere.</p>
            <p>Arloch finally understood that this was the feeling he lived for. Protecting the ones who were unable to stand up for themselves. Arloch swore he would never let a single life be taken by the self-righteous and uncaring Empire again.</p>
            <p>Eventually, more battles were fought and more battles were won. Gnarloch continued his training and became a stronger and stronger mage. Gnarloch started to gain a following too. Wherever he went, he had an army of supporters that would be sure to follow him in his cause. He was finally referred to as Gnarloch by those around him.</p>
            <p>For 30 years, Gnarloch fought. With great determination, he believed that he could free every town from the grasps of the empire. He made great progress, but this was not the case.</p>
            <p>He was taken by the empire at last. The empire, knowing he must be an example to be made out of, chose a spectacular method of execution. He was made to be turned into stone by the empire’s greatest mages.</p>
            <p>The execution happened, as much as Gnarloch’s allies fought against it. There was nothing that could be done. With his final breath he uttered “Let hope not die with me”. He was turned into stone.</p>
