    <p class="j">
        There are three types of magic in this world: Sun magic, Moon magic, and Star magic.
    </p>

    <p class="j">
        Sun mages have the ability to create fire and heat. However, this energy must come from somewhere. Sun magic slowly take energy from the environment and store it within themselves to release it in the future.
    </p>

    <p class="j">
        Moon mages are the opposite. While these mages have the ability to draw in large amounts of energy at once, they are unable to store it. It must be redirected. Moon mages have the power of necromancy and healing by redirecting their energy into a living or dead creature, and the power to cool the temperature or freeze by virtue of their method of gaining energy.
    </p>

    <p class="j">
        Star mages do not get their energy from the environment. Instead, they use their own energy to manipulate the environment around them. These mages have the power of geomancy, and even alchemy through manipulation precise enough to move individual molecules. However, since these mages do not get their energy from the environment, moving large objects is still a heavy burden.
    </p>

    <p class="j">
        All mages can learn any of the magic types, or any combination of the three, but it is incredibly taxing to become proficient at more than one.

    <h3 class=h>Schools of Magic</h3>
    <p class="j">
        ‚òÄÔ∏è <b>Pyromancer</b> - Pyromancers focus on siphoning as much energy from the environment as possible during down time and storing it to be able to execute large attacks when needed.<br><br>
        ‚òÄÔ∏è <b>Summoner</b> - Summoners use the power of sun magic to create summons out of their collected energy.<br><br>
        üåô <b>Thaumaturge</b> - Thaumaturges use the power of moon magic to take energy from the environment at a rate much faster than even the best Pyromancers. Even so, this collected energy cannot be stored.<br><br>
        üåô <b>Necromancer</b> - Necromancers focus on redirecting their collected energy as efficient as possible. This energy can be used to heal wounds or even animate dead bodies. Some necromancers may also learn sun magic to be able to store collected energy and use it at a later date.<br><br>
        ‚òÄÔ∏èüåô <b>Sorcerer</b> - Sorcerers have the power of both Pyromancy and Thaumaturgy. While this is powerful since this type of magic almost completely overcomes the shortcomings of Pyromancy, this type of mage is far and few between.<br><br>
        ‚≠ê <b>Alchemist</b> - Alchemists are star mages that focus on moving around atoms and molecules in objects to reshape them. The best alchemists can even manipulate objects at the sub-atomic level. Because they are usually not manipulating large amounts of earth, these mages don't need to worry about energy consumption very much.<br><br>
        ‚≠ê <b>Transmogrimancer</b> - Transmogrimancers are a subset of alchemists that focus on living creatures. They can shift the form of themselves or others through alchemy.<br><br>
        ‚≠ê <b>Conjurer</b> - Conjurers use the power of star magic to turn earth into summons. These can take the form of dolls, golems, or anything else that's made out of earth.<br><br>
        ‚≠ê‚òÄÔ∏è <b>Geomancer of the Sun</b> - Geomancers specialize in moving large objects through star magic. Because this requires a large amount of energy, Geomancers of the sun use sun magic to collect the energy needed.<br><br>
        ‚≠êüåô <b>Geomancer of the Moon</b> - Geomancers of the moon are similar to their sun counterparts, but they use moon magic to collect their energy instead.<br><br>
        ‚òÄÔ∏èüåô‚≠ê <b>7-colored mage</b> - 7-colored mages have the power of every school of magic. This type of magic is immensely powerful. Only a few in history have been able to reach this level of proficiency.
    </p>

    <p class="j">
        Not every mage fits entirely into one school, but these are a good baseline to recognize types of magic.
